# vibeCoding101 🚀

Welcome to **Vibe Coding 101** - An interactive workshop for students new to computer programming!

## 📚 What is This?

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook designed to introduce beginners to programming through the modern approach of "vibe coding" - using AI assistants like GitHub Copilot to help write code by describing what you want in natural language.

## 🎯 Who is This For?

This workshop is perfect for:
- Students with **no prior programming experience**
- Anyone curious about how AI can help with coding
- People who want to learn Python in an interactive way
- Educators running coding workshops

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- **Python Basics**: Variables, data types, loops, and functions
- **File Processing**: Working with text files, CSV, and JSON
- **Vibe Coding**: How to describe what you want and let AI help you code
- **AI-Assisted Programming**: Using GitHub Copilot as your coding partner
- **Real-World Projects**: Build practical applications from day one

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tesolchina/vibeCoding101.git
   cd vibeCoding101
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the notebook**:
   - Navigate to `vibeCoding101.ipynb` in your browser
   - Follow along with the exercises!

### Detailed Setup Guide

## 📖 Workshop Structure

The notebook is organized into sections:

1. **Your First Python Code** - Hello World and beyond
2. **Variables** - Storing and using data
3. **Math Operations** - Python as a calculator
4. **Conditional Logic** - Making decisions in code
5. **Lists** - Working with collections
6. **Loops** - Repeating actions efficiently
7. **Functions** - Creating reusable code
8. **File Operations** - Reading and writing text files
9. **CSV Files** - Working with tabular data
10. **JSON Files** - Modern data formats
11. **Data Analysis** - Basic analytics with Python
12. **Final Challenge** - Build your own project!

## 💡 Vibe Coding Approach

Instead of memorizing syntax, you'll learn to:

1. **Describe what you want** in plain English
2. **Let AI suggest code** using tools like GitHub Copilot
3. **Understand the suggestions** and modify as needed
4. **Test and iterate** to get the result you want

This mirrors how modern developers work with AI assistants!

## 🛠️ Tips for Success

- **Experiment freely** - You can't break anything!
- **Ask questions** - Use Copilot or the comments in the notebook
- **Practice regularly** - Try the exercises and modify them
- **Build your own projects** - Apply what you learn to your interests
- **Have fun** - Programming should be enjoyable!
